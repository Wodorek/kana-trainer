## General info

This is a simple webapp I created to aid me in japanese language study.
To start, select the groups on which you wish to quiz yourself, and press start. You will be presented with a series of questions, in form of cards, to complete. The questions are immediately validated, with progress bar and stats box informing you about progress.
When all of the questions are completed, you will be able to repeat the practice with the same groups, or choose different ones.
